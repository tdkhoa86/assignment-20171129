# DevOps Automation Goals:

A good DevOps automation challenge should:

* Resemble work the candidate might do
* Have a clear and consistant grading criteria
* Require less than 4 hours to complete

## Resemble work the candidate might do

Things that a Senior devops engineer should be expected to do:

* Provision a server for application deployments
* Build and maintain a software build system
* Create and deploy platforms to address cross cutting concerns such as
    * Logging
    * Secret management
    * Service discovery
    * Analytics
    * Load balancing
    * DNS resolution
* automating secure, scalable systems
* writing infrastructure code for the reader
* choose the right tool for the job

## Have a clear and consistant grading criteria

A clear rubric will allow better comparison between candidates, and set each candidate up for success.

Here are the grading criteria:

* System can be set up reproducibly and easily deployed
* functionally complete and correct
* secure
* documented (README, other comments)
* managed dependencies
* easily deployed
* idiomatic style for the tool chosen

## Require not more than 4 hours to complete

* A candidate's time is valuable, and reviewing a large code-base is also time consuming.
* Keeping a tight time-box on candidate take-home projects shows that we respect the candidate
* A short time window should cause a developer to pick certain things to do right, and others to do fast. In turn this provides a conversation point later on how they compromise.
